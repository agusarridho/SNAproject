<p>The StackExchange sites can be a great place to share knowledge and learn new things.</p>

<p>Due to some rude and inappropriate moderating of the Superuser StackExchange site (a sentiment unfortunately shared by quite a few people), I regret that I will be limiting my contributions there.  I do not share those values.  Hopefully things will improve.</p>

<p>The other StackExchange sites seem to attract much better quality and more friendly moderators, and thus have healthier communities.</p>

<p><strong>About Me</strong></p>

<p>I'm a high school student interested in computers and computer programming. I am an active member of Programmers.SE and Stack Overflow. If you tried to check though, you would think that I'm rarely on SO. I seldom answer questions as I really don't have the knowledge to do so, or the question has already been thoroughly answered. I mainly read questions and answers to learn.</p>

<p>On Programmers.SE, I'm ""Blog Overlord""! Yes, <a href=""http://programmers.blogoverflow.com/"">we do have a blog</a>. It's actually filled with great content. If you want to help out or write a post, ping me or World Engineer in the <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/2359/programmers-blog"">Programmers Blog Chat Room</a>. </p>

<p>I also oddly enjoy janitorial work around Stack Exchange.</p>

Most of my tabletop experience is with Pathfinder.</p>

M$ had this great idea to just integrate all of its software so that they would all work together seamlessly. This would be great for users of this software since this would make doing things like importing a webpage in a Ward processing (because in magicland we have wards instead of words) document, seemlessly and natively.</p>

<p>But this would evidently make the software too good. And we cant have people getting software that is too good. Because then if another company came along with their own version of good software people will be too dumb to install and use that if they have the already integrated versions that were included. So the Neanderthal Union decreed that M$ was using its magical abilities to make things too difficult for smaller developers to create super complex applications that they must give away for free. And said you will no longer make things work together seemlessly.</p>

<p>And instead of extending their middle wand to the NeU and saying fine we shall no longer make software that can be used in the NeU... M$ bowed before the luddites and said ok. So now you can not rename a file from inside of your office productivity suite in Magicland.</p>

<hr>

<p>I'm now a Product Manager, but before that I programmed professionally for over a decade.</p>

<p>I programmed mostly in C# (for about 7 years), though occasionally in a myriad of other tongues (Python for 2 years, Javascript for 2.5 years, Java for 1 year, C++ for a few years, C, VB.Net, batch scripts, Lua, Lisp, various DSLs).</p>

<p>I have written a whole bunch of automation for all sorts of programming tasks (long-running back end and batch processes, database migrations, code generation, code refactoring, CI, deployment infrastructure, test case generation, test lab/deployment automation infrastructure, and a whole boat load of automated E2E, integration, and unit tests).</p>

<p>I've done mostly web programming lately, with a little game programming on the side.</p>

<p>I dig Open Source Software.</p>

It truly is an incredible product with no limits.</p>

My conversion story was originally published in the Baltimore Jewish Times and was reprinted in its entirety by <a href=""http://judaism.about.com/od/conversiontojudaism/a/baruch.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">About.com</a> and in excerpt form by Rabbi Maurice Lamm in his book <em>Becoming a Jew</em>.  I learned Daf Yomi for 10 years completing the entire 11th Cycle and getting half way through the 12th.  I stopped shortly after being diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease and recognized I could not stay up for late night Daf classes nor keep up if I did not.  For the 20th anniversary of my conversion, I decided to teach the last daf of Kesubos and contacted Art Scroll for help, as they had not yet published their translation of that daf.  Rabbi Yehezkel Danziger surprised me by suggesting that I try translating the page for publication in order to make my celebration ""more special.""  It took me 3 months to translate the main text and the Rashi, but I submitted my work and, after much editing, received an editorial credit in Volume III of Art Scroll's Kesuvos translation.  I have been a frequent contributor to the About.com Judaism board and specialized in counter-missionary posts.  My website, ""A Primer:  Why Jews Cannot Believe in Jesus"" is designed as a quick introduction to major points I tend to make when dealing with missionaries.  In my secular life, I am an attorney for the Federal Government.</p>

<h3>Userscripts</h3>

<p>I've made some userscripts for the Stack Exchange sites you may be interested in:</p>

<ul>
<li>My SOOF userscript, now <a href=""http://stackapps.com/questions/6091"">Stack Overflow Extras</a>, has a bunch of optional features you can add to 'enhance' SE (examples of these features are: pre-defined edit reasons; keyboard shortcuts for pre-defined comments; highlight answerer's names in comments, and so on)</li>
<li>My <a href=""http://stackapps.com/q/6571/26088"">SE WYSIWYG Editor</a> userscript adds a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) Editor to Stack Exchange - definitely worth a try! :)</li>
<li>My <a href=""http://stackapps.com/q/6353/26088"">Freehand Circles Drawing Tool</a> userscript allows you to draw directly onto images you see on SE sites - you can change the brush colour and width to draw <em>anything</em> you might want - it's great fun, useful and easy to use :)</li>
<li>My <a href=""http://stackapps.com/q/6316/26088"">Self Destructing Comments</a> userscript allows you to set a date at which a comment you wrote should be deleted - useful for those 'comment cleanup', 'thanks', or 'welcome' comments.</li>
<li>My <a href=""http://stackapps.com/q/6460/26088"">SE Desktop Notifications</a> userscript shows desktop notifications whenever there is new activity on a question open in a new tab - useful for keeping track of questions without having to scroll through the answers to see if there is a new edit, or comment, or score change :)</li>
<li>See <em>many</em> more at my <a href=""http://stackapps.com/users/26088/"">Stack Apps profile</a> :)</li>

<p>Sorry, but I don't do <strong>chat</strong>.  Software development is a knowledge exercise, that requires concentration, and a lack of interruptions, to do well.  <em>Chat</em> forces constant context-switching, and loss of efficiency as a result of these interruptions.  I post on Stack Overflow in my free time, when I've already been interrupted for other reasons, but I can't spare the time to hang around in chat rooms.  Thanks for your understanding.</p>

<p>Before commenting on a post:  </p>

<p>• Almost all of my questions use fictional scenarios because 90% of the time my questions have much different requirements than normal. </p>

<p>• If it sounds like I'm asking for a library I'm asking how to accomplish something. If that's with a library or a code snippet. </p>

<p>• Sometimes I'll post a question and someone marks the question ""didn't research. found on Google"". No, I did research but the answer was insufficient, I couldn't find what you found or the answer didn't exist on SE. Usually it's both insufficient and isn't on SE. One day, I visited ten sites in Google search results that were down and I couldn't find the information I was looking for. I noticed a pattern. Sites seem to last 5 to 10 years. Some are here one day and gone the next. So occasionally I'll post questions for posterity because most likely I'll need to reference that answer again ...and I have had to go back to past questions in the past. Yes, the answer may exist somewhere else but in my defense Stack Exchange recommends writing full responses to questions rather than linking to other sites for this exact same reason. </p>

<p>If you're going to criticize my questions just move on. Don't even comment. </p>
