So for example if your team is down 4 or less runs in the 9th inning those stats would count the most. 1 because your facing the other teams best pitcher(s) and 2 your team is down. If you team is down 6 in the 9th it would be considered garbage time. Same with if your team is up 1 in the 8th and you hit a 3 run home run that would be worth a lot more than a 3 run home run in a 10 run game in the 8th.,2012-03-29T02:26:52.533,349

1674,1394,0,"I think the high-draw 8-iron would launch about the same as a straight 7-iron, because at impact the 8-iron would be slightly closed relative to its swing path thus imparting less backspin, more sidespin. I deleted my comment to re-format it so I'll simply restate: the amount of sidespin is actually a function of the difference between the swing path and clubface angles. The shot will draw (curve inside) when the swing path is outside the clubface angle. You get much more radical angles (more curve) by closing the clubface; the problem is that a closed clubface launches lower and to the left.",2012-08-13T17:18:23.663,528
1675,1394,0,"One thing I used to do is set my feet for a fade, *then* open my clubface. I used to be appaled that it would push rather than fade...

1676,1394,1,"So, if you want the highest, straightest-launching draw you can get, you want a square clubface. You can go higher by opening the clubface, but that then requires you to swing even further outside, first to simply get enough sidespin to curve the ball inside, and second to overcome the initial outside launch. If you go this route, I would also open your stance, which would aim the ball more toward your side of it at address.",2012-08-13T17:24:04.623,528
1678,1394,0,"You actually do have to focus on both. Unfortunately, ""open"" and ""closed"" are subjective terms, and it's the combination of the relative openness or closure of various parts of your stance and swing that determine how the clubface is pointing and moving when it hits. Basically, the higher you want it, the more open the clubface has to be (or the deeper under the ball you will have to get), but the more open the clubface is, the more outside it will launch and the less spin your inside-out path will induce. So, you have to keep the clubface angle pointing left of the swing path no matter what.",2012-08-13T17:37:15.557,528

5988,2955,0,"@edmastermind29 - No, because when the loft is printed on the clubhead, it does actually make a difference; a 9.5* head is the result of a different set of molds than a 10.5*, and the two will behave differently for different golfers. A strong swing is needed for a 9.5*, because the lower launch means that, all things being equal, it doesn't carry as far. But, that stronger swing now sends the ball out along the course instead of up in the air. For a 10.5*, it's the opposite; a slower swing will pop the ball in the air so that it stays there longer and so carries further.",2013-08-09T01:16:31.630,528
5989,2955,0,"However, with these new top-of-the-line adjustable heads in the R11 and R1, one head is shaped and constructed so that you can vary the launch angle by changing how the club fits to the shaft, and change the shape of the shot (draw/fade) by changing the weighting behind the face at the bottom of the clubhead. So, one head, made one way, can be anything from an 8.5 to an 11.5 loft, and anything from a Draw driver to a Tour driver, just by how it's configured.",2013-08-09T01:18:24.483,528

5992,2955,1,"Yes. The same swing, of a club of the same model, with the same shaft, but different loft angles, will cause exactly the behavior you saw; the higher loft will launch higher and have more backspin, so the ball gets longer hang time but doesn't travel along the ground as fast.

So, in order to get 6 more ""best results"" after the 4 majors & 8 MS events, you have to count one of the 250 level tournaments he played because there aren't any other tournaments left to take into consideration.",2013-09-08T11:28:03.043,18

Thus the efficiency for Australia was 307.4/140=2.195 km/l. As a comparison, A 1.6L Ford Focus is reported to do about 19 km/l, or x8.68 more fuel efficient. On a 80kmh speed, the Ford Focus would take 3.8375 hours to complete the race distance, whereas Nico Rosberg did it in 1.55 hours, x2.475 more time efficient.

That is not just applicable for the ""obstruction"" situations, but for pretty much all offenses. When there's an offense including physical contact, the correct decision is almost always a direct free kick (or a penalty, when inside the box). When there's a wrongdoing without contact, it's usually ruled an indirect free kick. There are of course a couple of exceptions, but it's a good rule of thumb for those who are not completely sure about the distinction.",2014-05-02T09:12:28.160,3517

10316,4871,0,If you're just starting out (only been playing a year or two) I would recommend just keeping the same toss for both serves.

Adding up the chances for 162 games, you are looking at 6500 - 7000 chances defensively.  That means somewhere between 75 and 150 errors.  If the batter puts the ball in play he can reach on an error.  Strike outs put little to no pressure on the defense.  Also when you are putting the ball in play, ground balls and pops ups will find holes.  Its a pure numbers game.

Using the sound is only a good idea for calls that aren't particularly close, or in games where the players aren't fast. Sound travels roughly 340 metres in a second. As an assistant referee, on average, you'll be about a tenth of that distance away, and potentially up to double it. Players in the modern game can approach 10m/s at top speed.

While it's not 100% clear, you can see that it is intended to be this way from the Infield Fly rule: * If a declared Infield Fly falls untouched to the ground outside the baseline, and bounces fair before passing first or third base, it is an Infield Fly.*  IE, it becomes treated as if it were fair, even if it initially lands foul.  You can also see this from the actions of catchers/fielders who are watching a bunted ball roll foul; once it is foul, they hit the ball with their glove to make it 'stay' foul, to make sure it doesn't roll back fair.",2014-11-03T22:00:03.343,6232

15103,7249,0,Joe - That's not true.  There are recent teams that moved to 4 man rotations.  Also see http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news?slug=jp-passan_four_man_pitching_rotations_090611 and http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2007-06-11-four-man-rotation_N.htm,2014-12-01T21:35:12.430,6436
15104,7249,0,"The yahoo article is long on supposition and short on stats - and they're arguing for pitchers pitching on 4 days rest still, not what @pacoverflow was talking about (2-3 days rest).  As far as Wooley's article, I'd love to see the data there; if he's only looking since 1972, he's almost exclusively looking at knuckleballers and aces, as fewer than 30 pitchers per year would qualify for his baseline (>8 games on 3 and on 4 days rest each).",2014-12-01T22:42:59.923,6232
15105,7249,0,"Also note that the period centered around the 1960s that had lots of 4 man rotations was the period of pitcher dominance; the mound was raised for that decade, so it was much easier to pitch - meaning pitchers had many fewer pitches thrown, and lower leverage pitches (so they don't have to work as hard).  Look at the graph on [this article](http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=22423#commentMessage) - 20% in the 50s, suddenly in the 60s 40% 3 days rest, then back down again after the mound was lowered.",2014-12-01T22:52:42.680,6232

15113,7164,0,@edmastermind29 - your comments are correct from the NFL players point of view.  For the NFL it makes sense because people pay money to see stars play and extra time off means stars have a better chance to be on the field.  From an entertainment aspect you are right.  But they could play every few days - which Dallas just played on Sunday night then Thursday.  This would be a truer test of how good an entire team is.  But the NFL isn't selling that product.

15114,7249,0,"Thanks for the interesting links, Joe. Even if the 5-man rotation has been the norm since the 1930s, there were still some pitchers into the 1980s who would pitch maybe half their starts on 3 days rest. That just doesn't happen nowadays. I disagree with your [first comment](http://sports.stackexchange.com/questions/7221/why-cant-modern-starting-pitchers-consistently-pitch-on-2-3-days-rest#comment15100_7249) that there's no evidence - the game data is all there.",2014-12-02T19:26:51.807,3763
15115,7249,0,So it's possible to analyze if pitchers up until the 1980s pitched better in the postseason on 3 days rest (when they were trained to do so) than the pitchers after 2000 who have usually struggled in the postseason on 3 days rest (when they haven't been trained to do so).,2014-12-02T19:28:29.237,3763
15116,7249,0,"The problem is that it's not _really_ possible to analyze that, because there are too few of them, and there's somewhat of a selection bias likely at play: you had knuckleballers and certain kinds of pitchers (Maddux like) who didn't really need the power that modern pitchers seem to.  Essentially, you had pitchers who were capable of pitching competently on three days rest doing so; but it was a very small number of them.  The modern pitchers doing so in the playoffs are basically normal (but star-level) pitchers, who might not be well suited to the task generally.",2014-12-02T20:37:56.500,6232
15117,7249,0,"The more natural experiment would be does 5 days rest versus *6* days rest make a difference (in which case you could suggest that 4 vs 5 makes a difference); many teams use true 5 man rotations, which means pitchers will sporadically and randomly pitch with 6 days rest and 5 days rest (ie, an unbiased random selection).  This doesn't answer the question of do pitchers get tired pitching too much, but it does answer the question of is a single start superior when on an extra day of rest, which is also interesting.",2014-12-02T20:40:00.000,6232

16519,7464,0,Delay of game is declined on a regular basis in college games.  Offense has the ball on the opponents 43 and 4th and 4 yards to go.  Offense takes field and hard counts trying to draw defense off.  Offense has no intent in snapping and doesn't want to burn a timeout so delay of game.  Now defense wants to make offense punt from 43 vs 48 so that (their perception) there is a more likely chance of a touchback.  What I never understood is if offense wants to punt from 48 why doesn't the guard/tackles on punt team clock the d-line ahead of snap... not that my guys ever did this.,2015-01-12T20:24:12.703,6436

16527,8541,1,I think this depends and I doubt there is anything other than circumstantial evidence out there.  First it really only affects teams that rely heavily on communication (like Oregon in their blur offense) and then it also matters where the game is.  Traveling distance has been proven to be a huge factor for outcomes.  Then the last thing is the most obvious.  A team expected to win will almost certainly have more fans traveling.

That doesn't mean you expect the coin to alternate heads and tails. In probability theory, if you flip a coin long enough, you actually expect that any length streak of heads WILL happen eventually, no matter how long the streak is.

He's at that point not any point closer to home than third, so Murphy is clearly at the same point as him - so either he is ""behind"" third (and Murphy is automatically out) or he is ""at"" third (so Murphy is out once tagged).  Laz's explanation in the article makes this very clear that this is their basis for the ruling of only one out - solely that he gave himself up.",2015-07-02T17:28:30.593,6232
17812,10610,1,"There is just nothing in the rulebook that cites that a player that is closer to home plate overran another player.  For instance I have see plays (especially at youth level) where a runner rounds third too late and ends up over by the dugout.  The trailing runner hits third base.  At that point in time he might be ""closer"" to home than the guy ahead that slipped.  So would he get called out for passing?

18813,12287,0,"@kuzzooroo - YES!  and YES!  What you are referring to is ""winged"" formations.  If you watch a lot of the read option teams now they do exactly as you have proposed.  They will zone block leaving the read DE open and then pull the guard and center with the wing.  Witten just lit up a poor Giants DE last night out of this action.  Why?  because the angle is unexpecting.  The tackle crosses in front of you and you think you have him beat and then bam you are blindsided.  Imagine me being able to do this with MORE players.",2015-10-26T16:22:09.090,6436
18814,12287,0,"@kuzzooroo - Also this is the exact reason why coaches pull their lineman.   It isn't just to produce numbers at the point of attack, it is also to alter the angle of attack.  This is quite effective against a smaller/penetrating D-front.  But when you are pulling you basically step backwards and then  sideways.  If these guys were in the backfield they would be running forward the whole time.  I would love to have 3 down lineman and a couple of 280 pound fullbacks that love to dive at knees.  Your D-Line would be sitting in wheelchairs or jumping back every play. - reason for the rule.",2015-10-26T16:27:26.667,6436

18830,12333,0,What about this scenario from the defensive standpoint.  Could the outfielder intentionally bobble the ball while running forward at the same time?  Sort of like playing volleyball with himself.  Eventually he would reach the infield.  Then he can finally catch and control the ball.  At this point the runner on third won't run because he is too likely to get thrown out.  Is the legal?,2015-10-28T20:17:55.530,10211
18831,12333,0,"There are specific rules against Infield players intentionally dropping or bobbling the ball in an attempt to create a double-play scenario.  I don't know of any rules prohibiting the outfielders from doing that, but it would seem ridiculous.",2015-10-28T20:20:03.980,9300

18846,12351,1,@Gaurav its not really sexism mate. Every sport has different competitions for women and men because of the differences between the two genders. There will be strong women and weak me out there. But its a scientific fact that men are generally stronger than women. Take athletics for example. Usain Bolt's world record 100m sprint was completed in 9.58 seconds. The world record for the women's 100m sprint is 10.49 seconds held by Florence Griffith-Joyner. 900 milliseconds is a world of difference in the 100m sprint. Its just how men and women are made.,2015-10-30T12:26:46.420,10215

We sadly have a few issues re: some of those suggestions.
Few chances of competitive play (~12 competitive games a year), ~ 0.8 practice a week due to a number of reasons (personal priorities and logistics mostly), a small roster (scrimmaging can usually happen with smaller teams -> different game dynamics). I'm trying ways to motivate them to train individually to make up for it, with mixed results.
I love the idea of focussing my attention on pushing only/mostly the top players and have them lead the others by example: focus on fewer players -> result on entire team.",2016-01-06T23:19:17.440,3490
19425,12764,0,"I'm also curious which local teams you have seen!
Btw we indeed don't have a majority of ""real athletes"" over our entire league(s), but I would say top teams especially in the USA do.
2 players scoring 95% happens, but not in our case: e.g. we have a twice national american football champion (it's like saying US rugby champion, sure...) as chaser, but a beater lineup that averages below many other teams.
""Star players"" at beater have a bigger impact, but the question ""why is one guy managing to stop all the plays from the other team single handedly"" is not as pressing as the one you mention :)",2016-01-06T23:20:25.150,3490
19426,12764,1,@MicheleC - From the looks of it if quidditch was played at a pretty high level it seems that certain positions would require A LOT of running - A LOT.  I would focus on making sure everyone is in shape and basically tell them that they will be taking out if walking too much on the field.  I would expect that even the athletes will over estimate the shape they are in.  A sport like that can be really hard to coach if everyone is dragging ass.  If players are too out of shape you don't even understand their skill level and they certainly can't improve.,2016-01-06T23:22:32.653,6436

You are right in assuming the offence is generally affected more by this peculiarity of the game, so for the defence it really boils down to optimizing rotations accounting for this aspect (i.e. you don't only rotate on passes, shots, and defenders beaten by the ball carrier, but also in case of players taken out).
I like the simplicity in ""we are X players down, reset the ball unless you have a clean chance to drive to the hoops"", I suppose you'd only need some exceptions in order to not become easy to anticipate.",2016-01-08T13:19:26.517,3490

19630,11863,0,@PhilipKendall - Baserunning rules are universal.  The pitcher would step on mound and then off and throw to third base to appeal.  Or in some cases would just hold the ball and tell umpire she wants to appeal.  The runner is called out for sure for missing the bag.  What the author needs to tell us is where the other runners went and how many outs there were because that is where it can get interesting.,2016-01-25T16:17:21.403,6436

I watched that game, and couldn't understand why he was trying to return it - I suppose the 2 points would've meant a patriots onside kick and then field goal doesn't win them the game, but with 12 seconds left and no time outs, it seems unlikely the Patriots would be able to get in field goal range (the recovery spot is the 45 typically, so at least 15-20 yards downfield even for a 'hard' score) in that span of time.

19646,12938,0,"Thanks, @Joe. I actually had this same conversation with a coworker earlier today. I hold the opinion that it made sense to return it, if for nothing else, to make it a 4-point game rather than a 2-point game. Yes, it is probably the smartest and safest play to not return it to keep it a 2-point game, but it isn't out of the realm of possibility that the Patriots could recover at the 45, have a well-designed 20-yard out to the sideline to set up a potential game winning ~52 yard field goal.

Therefore, there is less friction on the top part of the ball vs the bottom of the ball, because the top of the ball is moving more slowly through the air relative to the bottom part of the ball because of the direction of airflow.

Sometimes fouls during quickplays are done to stop the attack, but the referee allows the player to pick up the ball and resume the play as fast as possible, in that case, a whistle is not customary.

Lamine Kone looked to have been the goal-scorer, but replays showed United keeper David De Gea had saved the shot which then bounced off his leg and rolled in. So it counted as a De Gea own goal.
