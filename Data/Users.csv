<p><strong>About Me</strong></p>

<p>I'm a high school student interested in computers and computer programming. I am an active member of Programmers.SE and Stack Overflow. If you tried to check though, you would think that I'm rarely on SO. I seldom answer questions as I really don't have the knowledge to do so, or the question has already been thoroughly answered. I mainly read questions and answers to learn.</p>

<p>On Programmers.SE, I'm ""Blog Overlord""! Yes, <a href=""http://programmers.blogoverflow.com/"">we do have a blog</a>. It's actually filled with great content. If you want to help out or write a post, ping me or World Engineer in the <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/2359/programmers-blog"">Programmers Blog Chat Room</a>. </p>

<p>I also oddly enjoy janitorial work around Stack Exchange.</p>

M$ had this great idea to just integrate all of its software so that they would all work together seamlessly. This would be great for users of this software since this would make doing things like importing a webpage in a Ward processing (because in magicland we have wards instead of words) document, seemlessly and natively.</p>

<p>But this would evidently make the software too good. And we cant have people getting software that is too good. Because then if another company came along with their own version of good software people will be too dumb to install and use that if they have the already integrated versions that were included. So the Neanderthal Union decreed that M$ was using its magical abilities to make things too difficult for smaller developers to create super complex applications that they must give away for free. And said you will no longer make things work together seemlessly.</p>

<p>And instead of extending their middle wand to the NeU and saying fine we shall no longer make software that can be used in the NeU... M$ bowed before the luddites and said ok. So now you can not rename a file from inside of your office productivity suite in Magicland.</p>

<p>I'm now a Product Manager, but before that I programmed professionally for over a decade.</p>

<p>I programmed mostly in C# (for about 7 years), though occasionally in a myriad of other tongues (Python for 2 years, Javascript for 2.5 years, Java for 1 year, C++ for a few years, C, VB.Net, batch scripts, Lua, Lisp, various DSLs).</p>

<p>I have written a whole bunch of automation for all sorts of programming tasks (long-running back end and batch processes, database migrations, code generation, code refactoring, CI, deployment infrastructure, test case generation, test lab/deployment automation infrastructure, and a whole boat load of automated E2E, integration, and unit tests).</p>

<p>I've done mostly web programming lately, with a little game programming on the side.</p>

<p>I dig Open Source Software.</p>

  If you want to become an expert programmer, google SOLID, buy GOF, buy POEAA, buy Clean Code, learn Refactoring, lookup GRASP, DDD, CQRS, DCI … but dont ask for PHP books. That's the most reasonable suggestion I can give you when you ask for Expert PHP books really.</p>

<p>Before commenting on a post:  </p>

<p>• Almost all of my questions use fictional scenarios because 90% of the time my questions have much different requirements than normal. </p>

<p>• If it sounds like I'm asking for a library I'm asking how to accomplish something. If that's with a library or a code snippet. </p>

<p>• Sometimes I'll post a question and someone marks the question ""didn't research. found on Google"". No, I did research but the answer was insufficient, I couldn't find what you found or the answer didn't exist on SE. Usually it's both insufficient and isn't on SE. One day, I visited ten sites in Google search results that were down and I couldn't find the information I was looking for. I noticed a pattern. Sites seem to last 5 to 10 years. Some are here one day and gone the next. So occasionally I'll post questions for posterity because most likely I'll need to reference that answer again ...and I have had to go back to past questions in the past. Yes, the answer may exist somewhere else but in my defense Stack Exchange recommends writing full responses to questions rather than linking to other sites for this exact same reason. </p>

<p>If you're going to criticize my questions just move on. Don't even comment. </p>

<p>
A user interface is well-designed when the program behaves exactly how the user thought it would.
</p>

<p>There is no right answer ... and always a better way. Show and discuss your code, without emotional attachment. You are not your code.</p>

<p>Focused, hard work is the real key to success. Keep your eyes on the goal, and just keep taking the next step towards completing it.</p>

<p>We’re building something here ... and all the pieces matter.</p>

<p>The game isn't really about big edges and firework displays; it's about subtle advantages and what happens in the long run.</p>

<p>It is amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care who gets credit.</p>

<p>Maybe the best programmers aren’t those who spectacularly solve crazy problems, but those who don’t create them, which is much more silent.</p>

<p>Learn almost anything for free.</p>

<p>If you have any skill and like to teach, trust me, someone is wanting to learn from you right now, and in many cases, even willing to pay for it.</p>

<p>Last 1.9 year I made over 4565000rs./ $83,000 US selling one course alone (This One). In this course you'll learn with all detail exactly how I made that happen so you can do the same.</p>

<p>I have decided to make this training FREE. So All curious and skilled people can be trainer and say entrepreneur and make money and fame like khan academy, lynda.com, Pinal dave, www.hanselman.com  .Why I do charity because now I am satisfied with this amount of money. and I am planning to make new trainings to sale. </p>

<p>I will teach you how to create your own online course, make it look awesome, promote it, sell it, and make money with it.
Sounds good? </p>

<p>well here is exactly what we will cover:</p>

<p>Getting started: how to break down your course, all the tools you can use to create a course, and how to make it interesting so people actually listen!</p>

<p>Creating a great course: I'll teach you how to create a super cool presentation using Keynote</p>

<p>Recording your course: once you create your presentation you need to record it. I'll teach you how to use ScreenFlow for Mac to record your computer screen and yourself and how to edit it all together.</p>

<p>How to promote your course: once you have created your course it is time world know it exists! I'll teach you the most efficient ways to promote your course and find students.</p>

<p>Making money selling your course: how much to charge for your course? I'll teach you how to create a great sales page for your course, how to use PayPal to make money selling your course, finding affiliates, and much more!
Just like you I have invested zillions of dollars and many years educating myself, learning new skills. It's time to share that hard earned knowledge with the world and creating an online course is one of the best ways to do so, reach thousands of people and why not make some money on the side.</p>

<p>Are you ready? Let's do it!</p>

And if I have prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith so that I can remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. If I give away everything I own, and if I give over my body in order to boast,1 but do not have love, I receive no benefit. </p>

<p>Love is patient, love is kind, it is not envious. Love does not brag, it is not puffed up. It is not rude, it is not self-serving, it is not easily angered or resentful. It is not glad about injustice, but rejoices in the truth. It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. </p>

<p>Love never ends. But if there are prophecies, they will be set aside; if there are tongues, they will cease; if there is knowledge, it will be set aside. For we know in part, and we prophesy in part, but when what is perfect comes, the partial will be set aside. When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. But when I became an adult, I set aside childish ways. For now we see in a mirror indirectly, but then we will see face to face. Now I know in part, but then I will know fully, just as I have been fully known. And now these three remain: faith, hope, and love. But the greatest of these is love. </p>

<p>my cameras:</p>

<li>To gut toy RC cars and redo their electronics</li>

<li>ASP.NET MVC, (Web API)</li>
<li>trusty console apps :)</li>
<li>XAML apps,</li>

<p>I've been moving towards the web side of things, so JQuery, LESS etc are becoming increasingly important.</p>

<p>Database wise - whilst I've done a lot of the different types, at the moment most of my time is spent with:</p>

<ul>
<li>RavenDB (Document DB)</li>
<li>Neo4j (Graph DB)</li>
</ul>

<p>And Neo4j is winning in being one of the nicest DB's I've <em>ever</em> worked with. I've dealt with RDBMS databases (SQL Server, MySQL), but I wouldn't class myself as a DBA :)</p>

<p>I'm learning F# and Haskell (slowly), but at the moment I am mostly a C# developer (which I have to say I thoroughly enjoy).</p>

<p>Personally - I waveski (whaaaat? <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wOCsSFm6-c"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Waveskiing"">Video here</a>) and run competitions in the UK (via <a href=""http://www.tournr.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Tournr</a>), I also do the traditional things of reading, eating, breathing, but we all know that... and I've just taken up (after a 20 year hiatus) the Piano.</p>

And in no time he grasped the ins &amp; outs of WordPress and made it the crux of his profession.</p>

<p>He’s a proud contributor to WordPress 4.1, 4.2 &amp; 4.3, and maintains a couple of plugins on the WordPress repository &amp; Github with the belief in Open Source future of Web &amp; its equilibrium.</p>

<p>When he’s not looking at his black window of terminal, he is rambling into his incognito mind, dreaming about that damn cool EF180mm f/3.5L Macro USM Lens with a pixel perfect picture from his DSLR or how good cricketer he would have been; if not a developer. He's also a Foodie &amp; a Movie-buff!</p>

My conversion story was originally published in the Baltimore Jewish Times and was reprinted in its entirety by <a href=""http://judaism.about.com/od/conversiontojudaism/a/baruch.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">About.com</a> and in excerpt form by Rabbi Maurice Lamm in his book <em>Becoming a Jew</em>.  I learned Daf Yomi for 10 years completing the entire 11th Cycle and getting half way through the 12th.  I stopped shortly after being diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease and recognized I could not stay up for late night Daf classes nor keep up if I did not.  For the 20th anniversary of my conversion, I decided to teach the last daf of Kesubos and contacted Art Scroll for help, as they had not yet published their translation of that daf.  Rabbi Yehezkel Danziger surprised me by suggesting that I try translating the page for publication in order to make my celebration ""more special.""  It took me 3 months to translate the main text and the Rashi, but I submitted my work and, after much editing, received an editorial credit in Volume III of Art Scroll's Kesuvos translation.  I have been a frequent contributor to the About.com Judaism board and specialized in counter-missionary posts.  My website, ""A Primer:  Why Jews Cannot Believe in Jesus"" is designed as a quick introduction to major points I tend to make when dealing with missionaries.  In my secular life, I am an attorney for the Federal Government.</p>

  <p>Of all the unimportant things in life, physics is the most important</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hat-tip to Arrigo Sacchi for this quote.</p>

<p>My interests are high-energy physics and phenomenology, and the application of (Bayesian) statistics in those topics.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree, And a small cabin build
  there, of clay and wattles made; Nine bean rows will I have there, a
  hive for the honey bee, And live alone in the bee loud glade.</p>
  
  <p>And I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow,
  Dropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings;
  There midnight's all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow, And evening
  full of the linnet's wings.</p>
  
  <p>I will arise and go now, for always night and day I hear lake water
  lapping with low sounds by the shore; While I stand on the roadway, or
  on the pavements grey, I hear it in the deep heart's core..</p>

I've also thru-hiked the John Muir Trail (excellent scenery and hiking, too short), done the Coast to Coast Walk across England (an enjoyable way to visit England, but not backpacking), and expect to thru-hike other trails (definitely Pacific Crest Trail, maybe Long Trail, likely others).  In other crazy outdoor activities, I enjoy biking.  My biggest trip crossed the US, 37 days/~3875mi (not enough time, but also barely enough).  Loved it all, could have used more time (externally-imposed deadline forced the pace).  I think I prefer backpacking to cycling -- more remote, less like normal life.</p>

He spent too many years writing software <em>just</em> for fun on the side while working retail to pay the bills. </p>

<p>Martin picked up professional experience working as a private contractor for Nocturnal Entertainment Australia on the Game Boy Advance title Ultimate Arcade Games. With a shiped title under his belt he attempted to move into a full time position in the industry but ultimately fell short. 
Disappointed, Martin decided to return to school to flesh out his skill set. In the process he discovered he enjoyed the problem solving and design of complex systems more than the game development. He graduated at(or nearly so) the top of his class at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee with a degree in Computer Engineering. </p>

<h3>Userscripts</h3>

<p>I've made some userscripts for the Stack Exchange sites you may be interested in:</p>

<ul>
<li>My SOOF userscript, now <a href=""http://stackapps.com/questions/6091"">Stack Overflow Extras</a>, has a bunch of optional features you can add to 'enhance' SE (examples of these features are: pre-defined edit reasons; keyboard shortcuts for pre-defined comments; highlight answerer's names in comments, and so on)</li>
<li>My <a href=""http://stackapps.com/q/6571/26088"">SE WYSIWYG Editor</a> userscript adds a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) Editor to Stack Exchange - definitely worth a try! :)</li>
<li>My <a href=""http://stackapps.com/q/6353/26088"">Freehand Circles Drawing Tool</a> userscript allows you to draw directly onto images you see on SE sites - you can change the brush colour and width to draw <em>anything</em> you might want - it's great fun, useful and easy to use :)</li>

<p>I have been working as a software engineer since 2000. It is mostly embedded application developing. I often write or modify/port device drivers. All projects I was involved in I worked at low level programming with deep digging to a hardware specification. I managed with inner mechanisms of a number of RTOSes.</p>

<p>My story of engineering started with my first program that I had written at the age of eleven (11) years old. That was a little arcade game in pseudo-graphic written in Basic, based on ZX Spectrum compliant machine. The same year, in 1991, I realized importance and advantages of coding in Assembler, so I learnt Z80 Zilog's assembler instructions set and got my experience with it. From the 1998 I started working with microcontrollers at university lab, which was a mix of ASMs and C/C++. To sum up, I coded in a variety assemblers and architectures such as x86, Motorola HC08, AVR Atmega, PIC and ARM-7. From 2003 till now I have been working with C/C++ mostly as embedded engineer.</p>

<p>There were a several periods I worked with VHDL for ALTERA and XILINX FPGAs. Then I had my expertise with RTOSes (uC/OS-II, RTEMS). I also had a big experience with low-level developing like device drivers, data buses, protocols an so on. A number of drivers I have written from scratch, such as I2C, SPI, CAN, FAT, USB mass storage class. During the last years there were many chips I write support for, such as EEPROM, LED controller, battery charger/monitor, Ethernet PHY, variety of tiny I2C chips with different functions.</p>

<p>Sorry, but I don't do <strong>chat</strong>.  Software development is a knowledge exercise, that requires concentration, and a lack of interruptions, to do well.  <em>Chat</em> forces constant context-switching, and loss of efficiency as a result of these interruptions.  I post on Stack Overflow in my free time, when I've already been interrupted for other reasons, but I can't spare the time to hang around in chat rooms.  Thanks for your understanding.</p>

<p>I've been a hardcore fan of FC Barcelona for 15 years, but I can respect Barca's rivals, Real Madrid. Again- there's no need to slight other teams when the G.O.A.T. played on yours.

<p>Other teams I enjoy include the New England Patriots, the Chicago Blackhawks, the San Antonio Spurs, Atletico Madrid, and the Chicago Bears. I'm only a lukewarm supporter of the Bears (until they prove that there's hope for winning meaningful games), but my God, <strong>do I loathe the Packers.</strong> If you are a Packers fan, I'm sure we can get along; however, we're better off not discussing football. </p>

Through a strong foundation of knowledge and character, I am committed to the success and quality of the solutions I provide. I believe in cultivating a strong bond across the members of a project team with the goals of learning and a sense of shared purpose. I highly regard the relationship with clients, stakeholders and technical staff and strive to continuously grow and improve that relationship. </p>

<p>In the technical arena, I specialize in both front-end architecture, with a foundation on flexible, component-based views, and in back-end architecture, with a focus on service-based APIs. While I have no dedication to specific technologies, my most recent focus has been on Java solutions leveraging the Spring Framework. I've also implemented features on IBM platforms, including WebSphere Commerce and WebSphere Portal. The current list of frameworks I am regularly using include AngularJS, jQuery, Spring, Camel and Java. The primary databases I have been working on include Oracle and SQL Server.</p>

<p>DEVERES DO PROFESSOR</p>

<ol>
<li><p>O professor não abusará da inexperiência, da falta de conhecimento ou da imaturidade dos alunos, com o objetivo de cooptá-los para esta ou aquela corrente político-ideológica, nem adotará livros didáticos que tenham esse objetivo.</p></li>
<li><p>O professor não favorecerá nem prejudicará os alunos em razão de suas convicções políticas, ideológicas, religiosas, ou da falta delas.</p></li>
<li><p>O professor não fará propaganda político-partidária em sala de aula nem incitará seus alunos a participar de manifestações, atos públicos e passeatas.</p></li>
<li><p>Ao tratar de questões políticas, sócio-culturais e econômicas, o professor apresentará aos alunos, de forma justa – isto é, com a mesma profundidade e seriedade – as principais versões, teorias, opiniões e perspectivas concorrentes a respeito.</p></li>
<li><p>O professor não criará em sala de aula uma atmosfera de intimidação, ostensiva ou sutil, capaz de desencorajar a manifestação de pontos de vista discordantes dos seus, nem permitirá que tal atmosfera seja criada pela ação de alunos sectários ou de outros professores.</p></li>

Whatever there is to learn has to be learned the hard way.
Turn my concepts into a viable way of life by a process of repetition.

<p>Said that,</p>

<p>Beautiful is better than ugly.</p>

<p>Explicit is better than implicit.</p>

<p>Simple is better than complex.</p>

<p>Sparse is better than dense.</p>

<p>Readability counts.</p>

<p>Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.</p>

<p>Errors should never pass silently.</p>

<p>Unless explicitly silenced.</p>

<p>In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.</p>

<p>There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.</p>

<p>I'm a big fan of collaboration and knowledge sharing with seven years of professional experience in programming. Despite I have a solid Java full-stack background, I'm currently mostly focused on front-end, working with Polymer, AngularJS and Less, which I hope to discover and share more knowledge over them.</p>

<p>I am a freelance programmer based out of NYC. I grew up in Pittsburgh, PA, USA and still consider it my home. I have a background in medical robotics, computer-assisted surgery, and computational biology. I currently specialize in desktop applications, augmented reality, simulations, and embedded devices, as well as development project management. Since moving to NYC 9 years ago, I’ve fallen in to working primarily with new media and tech artists doing a lot of interactivity and large-scale lighting installations. I consider my current job to be creating tools that allow artists to naturally express themselves through software without limiting their creativity.</p>

<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>Python</li>
</ul>

<p>Right now, I'm learning Rust, with a bit of C on the side so I can understand how to use pointers better.</p>

<p>Having said that, some of the languages I'm considering learning in the future include:</p>

<ul>
<li>C#</li>
<li>Haskell</li>
<li>Rust</li>

  <p>I have a friend who's an artist and has sometimes taken a view which I don't agree with very well. He'll hold up a flower and say ""look how beautiful it is,"" and I'll agree. Then he says ""I as an artist can see how beautiful this is but you as a scientist take this all apart and it becomes a dull thing,"" and I think that he's kind of nutty. First of all, the beauty that he sees is available to other people and to me too, I believe. Although I may not be quite as refined aesthetically as he is ... I can appreciate the beauty of a flower. At the same time, I see much more about the flower than he sees. I could imagine the cells in there, the complicated actions inside, which also have a beauty. I mean it's not just beauty at this dimension, at one centimeter; there's also beauty at smaller dimensions, the inner structure, also the processes. The fact that the colors in the flower evolved in order to attract insects to pollinate it is interesting; it means that insects can see the color. It adds a question: does this aesthetic sense also exist in the lower forms? Why is it aesthetic? All kinds of interesting questions which the science knowledge only adds to the excitement, the mystery and the awe of a flower. It only adds. I don't understand how it subtracts.</p>

Highlights include Lockheed Martin F-35 Lighting II, Boeing 787 Dreamliner, Airbus A380, and China Comet Rail II (high speed train) programs. I also have experience in pneumatics designing valves for all sectors of industry. Prior to engineering I was a 9-year Environmental Chemist and Consultant to private sector and government programs.</p>

<p>I am also an active participant in the Libertarian movement and a humanitarian. I have the following message to the world:</p>

<p>If you are not questioning your world, your world becomes questionable. The road you take is not up to you. It is up to our well-intentioned yet misguided, wool-coated, fellow neighbors who outnumber us thousands to one. This is why we have a lot of work ahead of us in convincing the herd on how to liberate ourselves from the shepherds who intend on corralling you, me, our children, and everyone else to containment, slaughter, and pasture.</p>

<p>This is a fact of life for all who have fallen asleep while carelessly grazing in the greenest of pastures brought to you by American corporatism, the Federal Reserve, and Kool Aid. This is a most pernicious poison of the sweetest taste and one that we must recognize as having the ability of ending our existence.</p>

<p>Be wise and live long and prosper. But never do this at the expense of your free will nor of the life, liberty, or happiness of your brothers and sisters that are separated from us by oceans. Because if we do, it sets the precedence that it is also permissible to do this to us.</p>
